  <dd class="col-sm-9"><p>Personally, I went on an exchange because I wanted to improve my English, discover a new country and a new culture. I got to experience that and things way beyond. I always thought I was independent but living in a different country starting new all by yourself, has made me even more independent and confident in myself. I was lucky enough to have great roommates who became good friends and meet so many other kind people who’ve made me seen things from different perspectives. I have created so many memorable moments, which I’d later look back on with nothing more than happiness and gratefulness to have gotten this opportunity.
In life it is important to keep pushing yourself out of your comfort zone in order to grow. Studying abroad is an adventure that you will never forget, and you will make new friends from all over the world. It will learn you to appreciate other cultures and gain a greater understanding of the world. Not to forget, having international experience will look good on your CV as well, since it shows your ability to overcome challenges (which you are bound to experience) and your independence. For all these reasons I can strongly recommend anyone to go out and study abroad.
