    <h1><b>TIME TO LEAVE</b></h1>
    <h4><b> September 25th 2019 </b></h4>

      <p>The day started at 5am, because I needed to finish packing and then we left the house at 7:30am.
      When arriving at the airport I got surprised by some friends who came to say goodbye.
      It felt really nice being appreciated and loved, even from people I didn't expected it from.
      We all ate at the Burger King together and it was just such a sweet goodbye and a moment I will never forget.</p>

      <p>The flight to Manchester was really relaxed. It was a small plane, and the seat next to me was even empty.
      Some people had warned me for the moment being in the plane and flying away, that it then would feel so real.
      I didn't had that moment though, but it could also be because I still had my mom and aunt next to me, so I wasn't alone.
      At Manchester Airport we met up with the welcoming Keele committee and then we went off to Keele University.</p>

      <p>When we got to Keele University, we picked up our keys at the Student Accommodation and then a Student Advisor led me and some others to our accommodation at Barnes.
      Two of the girls who got there at the same time as me were actually my flatmates as well, so we all moved into our appartment together.
      We spent most of the day together as well, as we were doing a campus tour and went to get some dinner.
      The day was such a good start to this study abroad experience, but mostly because I got very lucky that I could meet people on the first day and became friends with them.</br>
      It made it feel like I wasn't alone in this and that we were all experiencing it together.</p>
