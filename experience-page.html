  <dd class="col-sm-9"><p>The day started at 5am, because I needed to finish packing and then we left the house at 7:30am.
  When arriving at the airport I got surprised by some friends who came to say goodbye.
  It felt really nice being appreciated and loved, even from people I didn't expected it from.
  We all ate at the Burger King together and it was just such a sweet goodbye and a moment I will never forget.</p>

  <p>The flight to Manchester was really relaxed. It was a small plane, and the seat next to me was even empty.
  Some people had warned me for the moment being in the plane and flying away, that it then would feel so real.
  I didn't had that moment though, but it could also be because I still had my mom and aunt next to me, so I wasn't alone.
  At Manchester Airport we met up with the welcoming Keele committee and then we went off to Keele University.</p>

    <p><b>Day 1&2</b></p>
    <p>When we got to Keele we got some coupons as well. The first one we had used on the first night for our free pizza and we played some games as well.
    For the next morning we got coupons for breakfast as well and we all went to get breakfast together as flatmates.
    After breakfast we had a few welcome sessions and it was great to see more International Students!

    Keele also has a 'Keele What's on' app and we saw that the donation stand would be on this day.
    So me and my two flatmates, went there to get some plates and pans and we got so much stuff for just 10 pounds all together!
    It was so much fun that we could really do this together as flatmates and also that we all just share our plates and pans, so that not everyone had to buy their own things.

    We did had a language assessment as well, which took 2 hours, but it was good to get it done.
    We needed to enroll on this day as well and this is where we got our Keele card!

    Because my mom and aunt were still in town, me and one of my flatmates went to the center to eat some food with them.
    We also wandered around the city center a bit and bought some groceries, so we could finally have some food in the house.</p>

  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Crafternoons have been one of my favorite things while stuyding at Keele. It is on every friday from a period of time and there are new crafts every week.
  I have been going every time that I already know the people who are organizing it and it just feels like a same place.
  It feels familiar and as a place where I can let all of my creativity out and just spend some time for myself.
  I always loved to craft, but when I got older, I just didn't had time for it anymore.
  That's why these Crafternoons are so helpful! They assigned a date and place and all the stuff you need to make it, you just have to come and enjoy it.
  And it's free as well! It has been such a great time doing all these crafts.</p>

  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>The Christian Union has been such a big part of my study abroad here at Keele and I am so grateful for this society.
    It is such a great community and the people are so nice. I made the greatest friends here and they made it feel more like home here.
    Because it is a society with weekly meetings, it was easy to meet people there and when I made friends, it was amazing to see them on a weekly basis.
    We could really grow together in our friendships and in our relationship with God and that is such a beautiful thing. </p>

          <p>We went to Nottingham on the 2nd of November an it was such a spontaneous trip. We actually wanted to go to Birmingham that day, but we booked tickets for the wrong day, so we decided at the train station that we wanted to go to Nottingham. </p>
