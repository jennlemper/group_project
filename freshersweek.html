    <h1><b>FRESHERSWEEK</b></h1>
    <h4><b> September 25th - October 9th 2019 </b></h4>

      Day 1&2
      When we got to Keele we got some coupons as well. The first one we had used on the first night for our free pizza and we played some games as well.
      For the next morning we got coupons for breakfast as well and we all went to get breakfast together as flatmates.
      After breakfast we had a few welcome sessions and it was great to see more International Students!

      Keele also has a 'Keele What's on' app and we saw that the donation stand would be on this day.
      So me and my two flatmates, went there to get some plates and pans and we got so much stuff for just 10 pounds all together!
      It was so much fun that we could really do this together as flatmates and also that we all just share our plates and pans, so that not everyone had to buy their own things.

      We did had a language assessment as well, which took 2 hours, but it was good to get it done.
      We needed to enroll on this day as well and this is where we got our Keele card!

      Because my mom and aunt were still in town, me and one of my flatmates went to the center to eat some food with them.
      We also wandered around the city center a bit and bought some groceries, so we could finally have some food in the house.

      Day 3&4
      We had another welcome session today and we needed to do our subject registration.
      There was a shuttle bus that took us to the city center and we bought some essentials again.
      I left with my mom and aunt to Manchester on this day, because they were leaving the next day.
      So I spent the rest of the day with my mom and aunt in Manchester. We ate dinner in the hotel and it was just nice quality time.

      We spent most of the next day in the hotel as well, until we needed to go to the airport. It was just a relaxing, chilled day with some great company.
      But then it was time to say goodbye as well, it was a precious and beautiful moment.

      I took the train back to Keele and met up with my flatmates and we all made dinner together.
