      <p>Crafternoons have been one of my favorite things while stuyding at Keele. It is on every friday from a period of time and there are new crafts every week.
      I have been going every time that I already know the people who are organizing it and it just feels like a same place.
      It feels familiar and as a place where I can let all of my creativity out and just spend some time for myself.
      I always loved to craft, but when I got older, I just didn't had time for it anymore.
      That's why these Crafternoons are so helpful! They assigned a date and place and all the stuff you need to make it, you just have to come and enjoy it.
      And it's free as well! It has been such a great time doing all these crafts.</p>
