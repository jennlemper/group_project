<h1> Tips and Tricks For Studying Abroad </h1>

<p> <h3> <b> 1. Actively engage in social activities.</b> </h3>
Many universities organize a lot of activities for new students to get familiar with each other and the university.
This is the perfect time to try out lots of new things and see what you like. By joining in on different activities at the start of the semester
you are guaranteed to meet loads of new people with similar interests. If you sign up for a specific activity, society or sport and you do not like it after all,
you are always free to drop it. This is a great opportunity to discover new interests.

</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 2. Say ‘’yes’’ to new opportunities you’ll get, and do not let staying in your comfort zone hold you back. </b> </h3>
This tip is along the same lines as the first one. Your study abroad should be an adventure. There have been a few times that I was not too excited about some specific activities because I felt it might not be something for me. You will only know if you have tried it. So that’s exactly what I did in those scenarios, and those activities have turned out to be some of the best moments I’ve had. I took a coding course, salsa/bachata and first aid lessons and at first I was a bit hesitant about all of them, since I thought it might not be for me. I have not regretted doing those things for one moment. Studying abroad is all about trying out new things, and you should not be afraid to take risks.
</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 3. Plan your budget. </b> </h3>
It can be really helpful to plan a budget in advance to avoid spending too much on unnecessary things or struggle during your stay. You can estimate your monthly spending on accommodation and food in advance, leaving you to reserve a certain amount of money for travelling as well. You will probably want to go on trips to discover the country and it can be wise to think about a few trips you want to make, since once you’ll arrive in your guest country, time flies.
</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 4. Learn something about the country/culture you’re going to visit.</b> </h3>
When studying abroad, you are bound to be faced with cultural differences. Whether this will be mannerism, food custom or the language, it is better to have some knowledge beforehand about what differences you’re expected to experience. This might avoid awkward situations that can arise when a specific gesture is seen as normal in your home country, but rude in your guest country. The common depiction of Dutch people for example, is that we are quite direct, in contradiction to the British people, who tend to be more reserved. For them, our directness might be perceived as somewhat rude which was something I kept in mind.
</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 5. Figure out what you need to buy/bring before arriving. </b> </h3>
  Whether the accommodation you are staying in during your study abroad is on an University campus or not, it is important that you know what will be provided. Will you need to buy pots and pans, pillows and sheets? Can you order this in advance? Are there stores close by where you could shop all of your essentials on the day you arrive?
  It feels much better to be prepared for this than to arrive and find out you do not have a decent pillow, for example, as was the case for us here. Coming from the Netherlands, I was used to a much thicker pillow and if I could have anticipated what was waiting for me upon arrival, I’d have brought my own since all the pillows in stores are the same, flat ones. ☹
  I brought a lot of small basic things which turned out to be quite useful. There might be specific things you use on a daily basis, which are not available in the country you are going to. Jennifer stocked up on a very specific mushroom sauce for example, and I brought my trusted chicken herbs with me. It might seem small and insignificant but such things do not take up a lot of space and you will be thankful for them.

</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 6. Engage with the locals. </b> </h3>
When studying abroad, you are bound to meet many other internationals to whom you can relate. Although this is great, getting to know the locals within your country will help you get the most out of your experience. That way, you will learn so much more about their culture and they will be able to give you the best advice on what to see, travel to and discover in their country. It might require a bit more effort to engage with the locals depending on the place you go to, but it is definitely worthwhile.
</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 7. Do not forget to <em> actually </em> study. </b> </h3>
  Being in a different country and meeting new people is very exciting. There are so many new things to explore that you might casually forget the <em> studying part </em>, in studying abroad.
  I know that for me it felt like I was on a vacation for at least the first 4 weeks I was studying abroad. Depending on your university, you might have all your exams at the end of your semester. I would really advice you to keep up with your studying and your deadlines so that the end of your period abroad will not be so stressful. I enjoyed myself too much at the start, which lead me to become very stressed at the end and having to skip fun activities to catch up. Procrastinating is something many people suffer from, but try to avoid this as much as you can by balancing your studies.
</p>

<p> <h3> <b> 8. Research payment options in your country. </b> </h3>
This might have only been something I personally wish I had known in advance, but depending on the country you are going to, certain methods you are used to paying with in your home country cannot be used in the country you are going to. I assumed that I could use my Dutch debit card in the UK since I was able to use in in the rest of Europe as well. However, I was not able to use it when paying in public transport or online, you had to use a credit card. I could not pay for things at my University online, not even my own accommodation fees. This could have been a problem if I did not know anyone whose credit card I could use. It therefore might be a good idea to research these things beforehand to avoid unexpected surprises. I would also always advice to have cash with you in the currency of your guest country, even if you can pay by card.</p>
