      <p>The Christian Union has been such a big part of my study abroad here at Keele and I am so grateful for this society.
      It is such a great community and the people are so nice. I made the greatest friends here and they made it feel more like home here.
      Because it is a society with weekly meetings, it was easy to meet people there and when I made friends, it was amazing to see them on a weekly basis.
      We could really grow together in our friendships and in our relationship with God and that is such a beautiful thing.</p>
