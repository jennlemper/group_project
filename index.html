          The day started at 5am, because I needed to finish packing and then we left the house at 7:30am.
          When arriving at the airport I got surprised by some friends who came to say goodbye.
          It felt really nice being appreciated and loved, even from people I didn't expected it from.
          We all ate at the Burger King together and it was just such a sweet goodbye and a moment I will never forget.

          The flight to Manchester was really relaxed. It was a small plane, and the seat next to me was even empty.
          Some people had warned me for the moment being in the plane and flying away, that it then would feel so real.
          I didn't had that moment though, but it could also be because I still had my mom and aunt next to me, so I wasn't alone.
          At Manchester Airport we met up with the welcoming Keele committee and then we went off to Keele University.

          When we got to Keele University, we picked up our keys at the Student Accommodation and then a Student Advisor led me and some others to our accommodation at Barnes.
          Two of the girls who got there at the same time as me were actually my flatmates as well, so we all moved into our appartment together.
          We  spent most of the day together as well, as we were doing a campus tour and went to get some dinner.
          The day was such a good start to this study abroad experience, but mostly because I got very lucky that I could meet people on the first day and became friends with them.
          It made it feel like I wasn't alone in this and that we were all experiencing it together.

          Day 1&2
          When we got to Keele we got some coupons as well. The first one we had used on the first night for our free pizza and we played some games as well.
          For the next morning we got coupons for breakfast as well and we all went to get breakfast together as flatmates.
          After breakfast we had a few welcome sessions and it was great to see more International Students!

          Keele also has a 'Keele What's on' app and we saw that the donation stand would be on this day.
          So me and my two flatmates, went there to get some plates and pans and we got so much stuff for just 10 pounds all together!
          It was so much fun that we could really do this together as flatmates and also that we all just share our plates and pans, so that not everyone had to buy their own things.

          We did had a language assessment as well, which took 2 hours, but it was good to get it done.
          We needed to enroll on this day as well and this is where we got our Keele card!

          Because my mom and aunt were still in town, me and one of my flatmates went to the center to eat some food with them.
          We also wandered around the city center a bit and bought some groceries, so we could finally have some food in the house.

          Day 3&4
          We had another welcome session today and we needed to do our subject registration.
          There was a shuttle bus that took us to the city center and we bought some essentials again.
          I left with my mom and aunt to Manchester on this day, because they were leaving the next day.
          So I spent the rest of the day with my mom and aunt in Manchester. We ate dinner in the hotel and it was just nice quality time.

          We spent most of the next day in the hotel as well, until we needed to go to the airport. It was just a relaxing, chilled day with some great company.
          But then it was time to say goodbye as well, it was a precious and beautiful moment.

          I took the train back to Keele and met up with my flatmates and we all made dinner together.

          Crafternoons have been one of my favorite things while stuyding at Keele. It is on every friday from a period of time and there are new crafts every week.
          I have been going every time that I already know the people who are organizing it and it just feels like a same place.
          It feels familiar and as a place where I can let all of my creativity out and just spend some time for myself.
          I always loved to craft, but when I got older, I just didn't had time for it anymore.
          That's why these Crafternoons are so helpful! They assigned a date and place and all the stuff you need to make it, you just have to come and enjoy it.
          And it's free as well! It has been such a great time doing all these crafts.
